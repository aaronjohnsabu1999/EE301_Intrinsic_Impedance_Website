# EE301_Intrinsic_Impedance_Website

This repository contains files for a website which describes the variation of intrinsic impedance in certain forms of carbon, developed for the final assignment of EE301 (Electromagnetic Waves). It also contains the Matlab code used to generate the plots.
***
Intended Changes: Plots comparing other metals, semiconductors and insulators, detailed descriptions regarding intrinsic impedance for beginners, etc.
