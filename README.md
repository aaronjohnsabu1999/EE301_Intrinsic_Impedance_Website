# EE301_Intrinsic_Impedance_Website
This repository contains the files for a website which describes the variation of intrinsic impedance in certain forms of carbon. It also contains the Matlab code used to generate the plots.

Intended Changes: Plots comparing other metals, semiconductors and insulators, detailed descriptions regarding intrinsic impedance for beginners, etc.
